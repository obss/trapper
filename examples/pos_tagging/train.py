"""
This scripts shows how to train a POS tagger using trapper. However,
intentionally, the dependency injection mechanism is not used, instead the
objects are instantiated directly from concrete classes suitable for the job.
Although we recommended config file based training using the trapper CLI instead,
you can use this file to create a custom training script for your needs.
