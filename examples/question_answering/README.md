This notebook serves as an example for demonstrating training and inference using `trapper`. Question-answering task is supported by `trapper` already, and thus in this notebook we only give a basic [configuration file](./experiment.jsonnet) and let the trapper take care of the rest. For implementation of a desired task using trapper, see [Pos tagging example](../pos_tagging).
